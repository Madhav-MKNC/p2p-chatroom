<p>Note this: </p>
<ol>
   <li>
      <p>Use a robust networking library such as <code>asyncio</code> to handle the network connections between the peers.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Define a protocol for how the peers communicate with each other. This protocol should specify the messages that can be sent between peers and how the messages are formatted.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Design a mechanism for electing a new server when the current server goes offline. This could involve having the peers periodically check the status of the server and switch to a new server if the current one is no longer available.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the chatroom and to ensure that messages are not intercepted or tampered with.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Consider using a database or other persistent storage mechanism to store the chatroom data, so that it can be restored in case of a server failure.</p>
   </li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck with your project!</p>
